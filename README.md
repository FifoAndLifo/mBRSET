Repository of the Mobile Brazilian Retinal Dataset (mBRSET)


Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Mobile Brazilian Retinal Dataset (mBRSET). 
This repository is dedicated to technical validation, data analysis, quality assessment, and modeling. It is a comprehensive dataset of retinal images captured with a portable retinal camera. The mBRSET is a valuable resource for the ophthalmology research community and aims to reduce the number of underrepresented countries in the dataset pool used for the development of models.
